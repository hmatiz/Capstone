    <h1>DIY Bees Wax Candles</h1>

    <h5> On cold winter nights, I love the warmth and flicker that a candle brings! </h5>
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <p>    Making candles is something that I really enjoy doing. I can't live without them. Being able to fully customize my candles, 
        ensures that there are no toxins inside them. I use wooden wicks and beeswax so they are minimal and I know they have clean ingredients. You may want to customize yours and add color, scents or other decorations. </p>

<p> <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    
    <h5>Prepare Your Workspace:</h5>

Lay down some newspaper or a disposable tablecloth to catch any wax spills.
Set up your molds or containers where you want to pour your candles.

<h5>Cut the Wick:</h5>

Measure and cut your wick to be about 2 inches taller than the container or mold you're using. You’ll trim it later after the candle hardens.
Attach the wick to the center of the mold or container. You can do this by securing the wick with a dab of hot glue or using a wick sticker, or simply tie the top of the wick to a wooden stick or pencil and rest it across the top of the container to hold it in place.

<h5>Melt the Beeswax:</h5>

Double Boiler Method: Fill the bottom pot with water and place it over medium heat. Put the beeswax pellets or chunks into the top pot and allow the beeswax to melt slowly. Stir occasionally.
Microwave Method: Place the beeswax in a microwave-safe container. Heat it in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval, until the beeswax is completely melted.

<h5>Add Optional Additives:</h5>

If you want to add color or scent, this is the time to do it. Stir in a few drops of essential oils for fragrance, or add candle dye if you want to color your candle. Mix thoroughly.

<h5>Pour the Wax:</h5>

Once the beeswax is fully melted, carefully pour it into your prepared mold or container. Pour slowly and keep the wick centered as you go.
Leave about ½ inch of space from the top of the mold or container.

<h5>Secure the Wick:</h5>

If your wick isn’t already secure, make sure it stays centered and straight as the wax begins to harden. You can do this by adjusting the wooden stick or pencil across the top of the container, ensuring the wick remains in the middle.

<h5>Let the Candle Cool:</h5>

Allow the candle to cool at room temperature for several hours, or overnight. The wax will harden and solidify.

<h5>Trim the Wick:</h5>

Once the candle has fully hardened, trim the wick to about ¼ inch above the surface of the candle.
Enjoy Your Beeswax Candle!

Your homemade beeswax candle is now ready to use. Light it up and enjoy the warm, natural glow and subtle honey scent.
